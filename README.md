# Hiker

Hiker is a Ruby on Rails powered hike tracker. It allows users to sign up and add hikes that they have completed. They will be able to add the stats of their hikes, such as distance, elevation gain, date completed, and location of the hike. Hiker will allow users to see their distance and elevation totals as well as how many hikes they've completed. 

Later version will hopefully include weekly, monthly, and yearly totals.
