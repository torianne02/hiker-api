# TODOS

1. Create `spec/requests/user_hikes_spec.rb`. 
2. Create `sessions_controller.rb`.
3. Update user and hike controllers to fit new model attributes and associations.
4. Create controllers for park and user hike models. 
5. Start adding logic to calculate user hike stats (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

## Future Possibilities

1. Map of user hike locations.
2. Users liking/commenting on other user's hikes.
3. Explore hikes by location (maybe add 'most popular').
4. Connecting Garmin and/or Strava to upload user_hike data.
